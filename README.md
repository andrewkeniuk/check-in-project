# check-in-project
Project for checking people in

Timeline:
Dec 18th, 2024: i have not figured out the steps to do this yet, and i am new to working with GitHub, so we will see how this goes,
the plan is to have google sheets -> sql -> some kind of site (java? html?) that can be used locally to check people in

i think i have the basic steps figured out, it may be very complicated and not efficient, but it will get me started on making something.
now i just need to learn html, that is all for now.

Dec 19th, 2024: learning html, slow day since i am tired today
