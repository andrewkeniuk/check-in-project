# check-in-project
Project for checking people in

Timeline:
Dec 18th, 2024: i have not figured out the steps to do this yet, and i am new to working with GitHub, so we will see how this goes,
the plan is to have google sheets -> sql -> some kind of site (java? html?) that can be used locally to check people in
