Project for checking people in

Timeline:
Dec 18th, 2024: i have not figured out the steps to do this yet, and i am new to working with GitHub, so we will see how this goes,
the plan is to have google sheets -> sql -> some kind of site (java? html?) that can be used locally to check people in

i think i have the basic steps figured out, it may be very complicated and not efficient, but it will get me started on making something.
now i just need to learn html, that is all for now.

Dec 19th, 2024: learning html, slow day since i am tired today

Dec 20th, 2024: ran into my first roadblock, i have to host the sql database remotely in order to import from google sheets (makes sense)
i will keep learning html and use a local database first before i look at using a remote one. dont really want to add people manually but
that is what i will have to do for now. shoutout to all the online tutorials helping me do this.

Dec 26th, 2024: i believe i am overcomplicating my situation (i also could not figure out how to connect everything without
containerizing it) so i will move on to trying to go straight from google sheets to html using apps script. i tried connecting via php as
well but it did not work, so i think i will take an easy route. i learned html tables and how to work them, and while the end result may
not be what i was hoping for, i still should have something that i like in the end.

January 7th, 2025: happy new year! today is january 7th, which means that classes have started again and it is my deadline for this project.

in short, i succeeded doing what i wanted.

in long, i accomplished this by using apps script on the google sheet created, and created the page using basic html and css. i also managed to add a search bar to it as well, which is a nice bonus. overall i learned a nice bit about html and javascript, which will help me in my upcoming classes.

i will publish the code whenever i have time (and once i figure out how to, for some reason i am struggling with github), but for now this project is officially done, something i am very proud of.
